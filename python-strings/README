These are some exercises using Python 3
The main objective is learning about strings.
In order to run this program from the command line:
-We will need python installed (version 3),
-Change Directory to where the file is located,
-write: "python" + space + name of the file + ".py" (.py extension)
eg: python repeat.py

I am getting some practice using GitHub and the Command Line (Bash)

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS:

repeat.py & myexample.py
store an input as string
print the input

keyboardControl.py
It imports a library that automates the writing process using the keyboard
It returns the string we previously wrote on our program 

carlsJungGame.py
I created this to have some practice using:
-inputs
-string concatenation
-string formatting using placeholders
The code is awful and needs to be refractored
however it is functional.
I will use this in the future as a web app,
the main focus will be:
Dry code
User Interface
